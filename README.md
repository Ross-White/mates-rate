## Description
Mates-Rates is designed to simplify planning trips and events with friends. The app allows users to create a trip; invite friends; share the itinerary; and make a note of all the costs of the trip for everyone to see. 

Making use of AWS SNS, the app sends messages to all the invited guests, informing them of the trip and inviting them to join. Guests can then sign up to join the trip and view the itinerary, costs and other guests on the trip. Users can create or join multiple trips and view each individally to keep track of all their different social occasions.
